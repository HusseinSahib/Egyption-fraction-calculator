Problem statement for project

For this program, you will implement a converter that translates rational fractions to Egyptian fractions according to the Fibonacci's 
algorithm (described later on). Egyptian fraction notation was developed in ancient Egypt, ~ 2000 BC, and one of the uses of Egyptian 
fraction was to handle fractional payment in business. An Egyptian fraction is a finite series of distinct unit fractions, where each 
fraction in the expression has a numerator equal to 1 and a denominator that is a positive integer. All denominators differ from each 
other. The value of an expression of this type is a positive rational number n/d.

Example: 
5/8 = 1/2 + 1/8

5/8 is the rational fraction
1/2 + 1/8 is an Egyptian fraction

Egyptian fractions can help in dividing a number of objects into equal shares, something that is very difficult to 
achieve with rational number notation. For example, if 8 friends decide to share 5 pizzas, the rational fraction does not offer 
any insight as to how to divide the pizzas other than to indicate that 5 pizzas need be split into 8 parts. The Egyptian fraction,
however, indicates that each person gets half a pizza plus another eighth of a pizza, e.g. by splitting 4 pizzas into 8 halves, and 
the remaining pizza into 8 eighths.

Your Python solution may not use Python constructs that have not been discussed in class so far. If you are unsure about using a certain
Python construct, ask your instructor before you implement your project using it. Your project should make use of while and for-in-range
loops where appropriate.
